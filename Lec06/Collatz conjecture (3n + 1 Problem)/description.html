<h3>Description</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Collatz conjecture</strong>, also known as <strong>3n+1 problem</strong>, which is a conjecture in mathematics that is about a sequence defined as follows: Let <code>S1</code> be a positive integer which is the start of the sequence, and</p><ul><li><p>if <code>Sn</code> is <strong>even</strong>, then <code>Sn+1 = Sn / 2</code></p></li><li><p>if <code>Sn</code> is <strong>odd</strong>, then <code>Sn+1 = 3 * Sn + 1</code></p></li></ul><p>The conjecture is that for any given positive integer <code>S1</code> (&lt;= 10^5), the sequence will reach 1.</p><p>e.g. Given <code>S1 = 22</code>, the sequence will be: <code>22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1</code></p><p>As students of NCKU, we are interested in this conjecture, please write a program to help us do some research in this conjecture.</p>
