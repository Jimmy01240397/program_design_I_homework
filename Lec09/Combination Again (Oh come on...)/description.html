<h3>Description</h3>
<div>
<p>Although you guys have done Combination in lecture 7 before (right?), you all notice that a factorial of a large number may cause overflow even with type <code>unsigned long</code>(what a nightmare. We all have learnt that there is another definition of combination:</p><p>C(n, m) =</p><ol><li><p><code>1</code>, if m == 0 or m == n</p></li><li><p><code>C(n - 1, m - 1) + C(n - 1, m)</code>, otherwise</p></li></ol><p>Please try to calculate the combination again with this definition.</p>
</div>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
An integer which represents C(n, m).
